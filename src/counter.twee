:: counter
You walk up to the counter and meet the dull gaze of a teenager dressed in a yellow and red polyester vest.

"How can I help you?" he squeaks.

"[[I'll take a large french fry|get a fry]]"

<<set $fries += 1>>
He gives you a french fry. Literally, a single large fry.
You now have <<print $fries>> french fries.
You start to [[head back to your seat|booth]], bewildered.
Although, the greeter [[in the lobby|lobby]] looks like she has something to tell you.
